# Numbertrain: A math practice web app
Orignally I created this to learn how to use React. It is inspired from the website www.monkeytype.com which is a website where you can practice your typing speed. It really has taught me how precise I need to be with my typing in both JavaScript and TypeScript which it is written in the latter.
